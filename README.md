## Features

- **Next.js-based frontend**: Modern, fast, and scalable user interface.
- **GraphQL API with Apollo Server**: Powerful and flexible backend architecture.
- **User authentication**: Register and login flows.
- **Redis and PostgreSQL integration**: Fast caching and persistent data storage.
- **Monorepo structure**: Both client and server code in a single repository.
- **TypeScript support**: Type safety and modern development experience.
- **Docker & Docker Compose support**: Easy development and deployment.
- **Ready-to-use theme and UI components**: Stylish UI with @xjectro/react and Tailwind CSS.
